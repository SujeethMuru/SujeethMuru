# 👋 Hello, I'm Sujeeth Muruganandam

🎓 I'm a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about building real-world software that simplifies life and solves practical problems.

💡 I enjoy creating tools, web apps, and AI-powered solutions that make daily tasks easier — from resume analysis tools to smart inventory systems.

🌱 Currently learning: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), full-stack web development, and AI agents with local LLMs.

🚀 Projects I've built:
- **AI Resume Coach Agent** – Local-first resume analyzer using Python, Flask, and Ollama.
- **Smart Inventory System** – A full-stack inventory app with low-stock detection and product management.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game** – A fun Pygame-based project with adjustable AI difficulty levels.
- (And more on my [portfolio website](https://sujeethmuru.github.io/SujeethPortfolioWebsite/))

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on meaningful software projects where I can grow, contribute, and learn new tech.
